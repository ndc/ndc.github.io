You are sitting in a car travelling at 120 km/hour, listening to a song that lasts for 5 minutes. At the end of the song you would have moved TEN KILOMETERS from the start!

How far is your office from your home? My office is almost 30 km from my home. So in that 5 minutes I have taken a third of the total distance between my office to my home.

The miracle of modern civilization :)

So how come on average I need 1.5 hours to get to office? &lt;clue&gt;rhetoric&lt;/clue&gt;
