From someone who is trying Jekyll for the first time (me):
* At first I thought I had to install jekyll gem, but further reading suggested that I can just git push the raw markdown to github and github will process the markdown.
* I was afraid to git push too many changes. Then I remember that I can git push --force a clean repo :)
* Github said that github pages refresh rate is 10 minutes per refresh. This is not true. As soon as I commit changes, I can immediately see my changes when refreshing my browser. Very nice!
* Very important pages for learning Jekyll: [templating system](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Template-Data), [page metadata](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter), [introduction](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html).
