From someone who is trying Jekyll for the first time (me):

* At first I thought I had to install jekyll gem, but further reading suggested that I can just git push the raw markdown to github and github will process the markdown.
* I was afraid to git push too many changes. Then I remember that I can git push --force a clean repo :)
* Github said that github pages refresh rate is 10 minutes per refresh. This is not true. As soon as I commit changes, I can immediately see my changes when refreshing my browser. Very nice!
* Very important pages for learning Jekyll:
    * [jekyll introduction](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html)
    * [variables available in templates](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Template-Data)
    * [how to set page variables](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter)
    * [reference for liquid template](https://github.com/shopify/liquid/wiki/liquid-for-designers)
    * [jekyll extension for liquid](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Liquid-Extensions)
    * [github flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)
